I am a dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast driven by a commitment to protecting digital assets and mitigating threats. With practical experience using tools like Splunk, Nessus, Wireshark, and OpenVAS, I have developed a strong technical foundation in threat detection, log analysis, and vulnerability management. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for problem-solving to a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role, where I can contribute to safeguarding organizational systems and data.

## Projects

Project Name: [Kali Linux Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS]

Objective:
To identify and prioritize vulnerabilities on a Kali Linux system using OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Management) and demonstrate vulnerability management techniques.

Tools Used:

- Kali Linux: Operating system for vulnerability testing.
- OpenVAS: Open-source vulnerability scanner for identifying and analyzing security flaws.

Process:

- Installed and configured OpenVAS on a Kali Linux VM.
- Conducted a vulnerability scan targeting the Kali Linux system to identify weaknesses.
- Analyzed the scan results, which included detailed summaries, severity levels, and recommended mitigations.
- Implemented fixes for critical vulnerabilities based on OpenVAS findings.
  
Outcomes:

- Identified high-severity vulnerabilities, increasing awareness of system weaknesses.
- Learned to prioritize and address risks to improve system security.
- Improved understanding of using OpenVAS for ongoing vulnerability management.

Project Name: SQL Injection Vulnerability Analysis

Details:
This project focused on understanding and analyzing SQL Injection vulnerabilities, a common web application security flaw. Using simulated scenarios, I explored how attackers exploit improper input validation to execute malicious SQL queries, gain unauthorized access, and extract sensitive data.

Tools Used:

- Kali Linux: For penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.
- SQLmap: Automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Burp Suite: For intercepting and manipulating web requests.
  
Objective:
- To demonstrate how SQL injection attacks can compromise web application security and to identify mitigation strategies to prevent such exploits.

Outcomes:

- Successfully simulated SQL injection attacks to gain insights into exploitation methods.
- Identified key application vulnerabilities caused by weak input validation.
- Developed recommendations for implementing secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection.

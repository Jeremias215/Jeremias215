## Projects

Project Name: Live SOC/Honeynet in Azure
Details:
In this project, I built a live SOC environment in Microsoft Azure, creating a honeynet to monitor and analyze security threats. Logs from various resources were ingested into a Log Analytics workspace and monitored using Microsoft Sentinel. Security metrics were measured in an unsecured environment, followed by the implementation of security controls to harden the setup.

Tools Used:

Microsoft Azure: Hosting the honeynet and associated resources.
Log Analytics Workspace: Centralized log ingestion and analysis.
Microsoft Sentinel: Alerting, incident creation, and threat detection.
Outcomes:

Identified and analyzed attack patterns in a live environment.
Successfully reduced security incidents and alerts by applying advanced security controls.
Demonstrated the effectiveness of hardening techniques in minimizing exposure and risks.

Project Name: [Kali Linux Vulnerability Management with OpenVAS]

Objective:
To identify and prioritize vulnerabilities on a Kali Linux system using OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Management) and demonstrate vulnerability management techniques.

Tools Used:

- Kali Linux: Operating system for vulnerability testing.
- OpenVAS: Open-source vulnerability scanner for identifying and analyzing security flaws.

Process:

- Installed and configured OpenVAS on a Kali Linux VM.
- Conducted a vulnerability scan targeting the Kali Linux system to identify weaknesses.
- Analyzed the scan results, which included detailed summaries, severity levels, and recommended mitigations.
- Implemented fixes for critical vulnerabilities based on OpenVAS findings.
  
Outcomes:

- Identified high-severity vulnerabilities, increasing awareness of system weaknesses.
- Learned to prioritize and address risks to improve system security.
- Improved understanding of using OpenVAS for ongoing vulnerability management.

Project Name: SQL Injection Vulnerability Analysis

Details:
This project focused on understanding and analyzing SQL Injection vulnerabilities, a common web application security flaw. Using simulated scenarios, I explored how attackers exploit improper input validation to execute malicious SQL queries, gain unauthorized access, and extract sensitive data.

Tools Used:

- Kali Linux: For penetration testing and vulnerability analysis.
- SQLmap: Automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Burp Suite: For intercepting and manipulating web requests.
  
Objective:
- To demonstrate how SQL injection attacks can compromise web application security and to identify mitigation strategies to prevent such exploits.

Outcomes:

- Successfully simulated SQL injection attacks to gain insights into exploitation methods.
- Identified key application vulnerabilities caused by weak input validation.
- Developed recommendations for implementing secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection.

Project Name: UDP Packet Analysis with Wireshark

Details:
This project involved using Wireshark to capture and analyze UDP packets to understand how UDP headers and fields function within network communications.

Tools Used:

- Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing UDP packet data.
- 
Objective:
- To study the structure of UDP packets, including header fields, payload length, and port numbers, and understand their role in network communication.

Outcomes:

- Identified and analyzed the four fields of the UDP header: source port, destination port, length, and checksum.
- Determined the payload length and the relationship between source and destination ports in request-response communication.
- Gained practical experience in using Wireshark for protocol analysis and interpreting network traffic.
- This concise and clear description highlights the projectâ€™s focus and connects directly to relevant skills for networking and cybersecurity roles. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

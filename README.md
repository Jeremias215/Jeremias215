I am a dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast driven by a commitment to protecting digital assets and mitigating threats. With practical experience using tools like Splunk, Nessus, Wireshark, and OpenVAS, I have developed a strong technical foundation in threat detection, log analysis, and vulnerability management. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for problem-solving to a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role, where I can contribute to safeguarding organizational systems and data.

## Objective
